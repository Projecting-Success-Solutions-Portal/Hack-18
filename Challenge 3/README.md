**UNSPSC – A spoonful of UNSPSC’s make the medicine go down**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: 
Quality/Right First Time

**Summary**

In order to catalogue the goods/services that we procure we use the United Nations categorisation coding convention. This groups the goods/services into distinct and defined hierarchal categories.

Currently, when the business procures a good/service, that is not already in the KBR (UNSPSC) catalogue, a UNSPSC code must be manually assigned based on a request form. Historically this has been very time consuming, taking up to 2 hours per code, and prone to mismatching. Can we create a system that improves the accuracy of assigning codes and drastically reduce the time it takes?


**Pain Points**

- I want to reduce the amount of time it takes for a good/service to be assigned a UNSPSC code
- I want to reduce the errors within assigned UNSPSC codes and ensure that projects are not being delayed by inaccurate data
- I want a system that can account for updates to the UNSPSC code library

**Personas**

- As a Project Manager, I want to quickly gain a UNSPSC code for any goods/services I acquire, So that I can progress my project and access all the correct resources.
- As a Project Reporter, I want all our suppliers and procurement to be assigned a UNSPSC code, So that I can quickly filter and structure reporting based on appropriate service sectors.
- As a UNSPSC Code Assigner, I want to be able to quickly assign a code to a good/service without error, So that I can improve turn around times and improve confidence in data accuracy.

**Context**

In order to catalogue the goods/services that we procure we use the United Nations categorisation coding convention to assign a code to the goods/services we procure. It enables the businesses to describe the goods/services in a common way, without referring to any supplier’s in-house catalogue codes and descriptions. 

Currently, when the business procures a good/service, that is not already in the UNSPSC catalogue, a UNSPSC goods/services enquiry/request is raised, to create a UNSPSC code for it. This enquiry is sent to the relevant person, who then creates the code based on the description that was provided for the good/service.

This is then inputted in the ERP system where the catalogue of the UNSPSC codes are kept for each good/service that the business has procured. This is a labour-intensive ,time consuming and prone to error.

How can we reduce the time it takes to acquire a UNSPSC code. What point of the process needs to be addressed and how do we ensure that the correct code is established and identified as fast as possible.

This challenge can be approached a few different ways, teams will have to decide the best approach themselves keeping both accuracy and time in mind. A simple approach is improving how a person can manually assign codes, is their a system that would make identifying the correct code easier based on the way data is structured. Would it be possible to use machine learning to identify terms and words that align to a specific code? Do we need to define a clearer way for project managers to submit their request for a code and how can we ensure that the correct information is passed on to improve accuracy?

How do we address suppliers already stored in the system when they have been assigned an incorrect code? Can we retrospectively re-assign codes? How do we identify and highlight codes that have been incorrectly assigned?

**Dataset Description**

The data for this challenge is the UNSPSC data library that can be found along with their terms of use agreement in the following links:
https://www.ungm.org/Public/UNSPSC

https://www.ungm.org/Public/Pages/Terms

Additionally, we will provide some anonymised request for codes along with the text provided to identify which code is needed.


**Output**

A system that drastically reduces error and time investment for assigning suppliers UNSPSC codes, whether that is an set of automation or a new interface for the data is up to you. As long as teams can demonstrate that they can accurately assign the codes it will be a successful result.

**Benefit**

The UNSPSC codes are an international standard provided by the UN and recreated in a wide variety of languages. A wide variety of organisations already use it widely but transferring to these codes and ensuring compliance is incredibly important. This challenge can produce a result that can be adopted by all businesses that use the UNSPSCs.
