**Project Execution Plan - simplifying, automating process**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: 
Contracts & Procurement

**Summary**

Creating a Project Execution Plan is an incredibly time consuming and cumbersome process. Gathering and collecting information from multiple sources and organising it into a comprehensive plan can be time-consuming and often becomes very complex.

What if we could automate the Project Execution Plan, or at least part of it. How much information needs to be contributed and how much can be generated automatically. Using a specific section of the PEP as your starting point, we want teams to identify the key information needed and use that information to generate the section. Teams will need to think about the writing process and how to maximise the efficiency of generating the PEP while ensuring that quality and accuracy remain top notch.


**Pain Points**

- Can we reduce the workload needed to produce the PEP without reducing quality and readability
- Can we ensure that data entered is correct and accurate
- Can we automate the generic section of PEP which would apply to most projects. As well as considering what would be needed for more specific sections
- Can we check readability and presentation
- Can we create prompts that allow PEP to become project specific
- Can we manage the EP as a dataset (or some parts of it, for example: programme duration, procurement type, form of contract, client type, industry sector, cost, project team) rather than a document and have the document act as an output rather than a source (afterwards data can be pulled out, analysed, etc)
- Can we ensure that the correct information is included and contributions are received in a timely manner
- Can we ensure that information within a PEP is up to date and relevant to the project stage (ongoing monthly reviews) and coordinated with RIBA stages. (Please note PEP is a living document)
- Can we define and select contents according to the recipients, how PEP is shared (internally, with client, with contractors, with consultants/Design Team or third parties (Due Diligence, Insurers, etc) when required, these parties may only receive partial information they need to know and not the entire document/PEP (for example: when sending to contractor PEP contain everything except…); Reformat document when it gets distributed as there may be sensitive information
- Can we make it easy to identify what might need checking and reviewing and what would need rewriting while potentially prompting solutions that indicate sections that need to be reviewed on regular basis/monthly. Please note that some PEPs could be written on approx. 40, 60 or 100 pages, 200 pages, etc (depends on project complexity)

**Personas**

- As a main Contributor (Project Manager), I want to know what I need to contribute to the PEP, when and how, So that I can ensure that I provide the right information at the right time and have confidence that my information is being checked and reviewed

- As a Client, I want to receive the PEP in a timely manner and updated as the project progresses during the RIBA stages and monthly report updates while still being readable, easy to decipher and contain accurate information, So that I can progress my project with confidence

- As a Contractor, I want to provide a complete and accurate PEP on time while ensure that work is carried out efficiently with minimal cost, So that I can provide confidence to my client and release capacity for my team

**Context**

Gleeds is a world-class independent property and construction consultancy with over 135 years’ experience. Gleeds vision is to create a business that attracts the very best clients, projects and people in the industry. The service is based on combining over 135 years of expertise and experience in new ways that make a genuine difference to projects. Through an entrepreneurial and flexible approach, Gleeds is prepared to look outside of the norm to find the perfect answer. 

We want you to explore the possibility of automating processes of creating Project Execution Plan (PEP) that has the potential to save time and increase the efficiency of project managers. It is important to note that automation can not replace the knowledge and experience of the project managers but can help streamline the PEP creation process, allowing project managers to focus on other critical aspects of project management.

PMs use different data provided by the team of consultants who are specialists in what they do: for example: Mechanical & Electrical, Architect, Structural engineer, etc. These consultants provide their part of information (input) for the project based on scope/client requirement. PMs only ensure that information is correct and as discussed. Information changes as project progresses. 

You will need to review the example Project Execution Plan provided, select a section you want to tackle then generate it automatically from the data relevant to that section. You will want to minimise the amount of information provided, put processes in place to ensure that the data provided is accurate from source and generate a result that is indistinguishable from the original.

You will need to consider if you want to use natural language generation to create the content or not. You will need to ensure accuracy while maintaining readability. Make sure you produce not only a system to generate content but a process to make that generation as efficient as possible while ensuring that the information provided is correct.

A PEP should be written in a professional, clear, and concise manner using business language. A PEP should be easy to understand and should clearly communicate the project objectives, scope, schedule, budget, and any other relevant details.

**Dataset Description**

You will be provided with 2 example documents. One is an example PEP and the other is a PEP information checklist. Both documents are examples and where not used for real projects, additionally the contain synthetic data.

**Output**

A successful output would be the ability to generate a section of a PEP based on raw data, this generation should be completely accurate and teams should endeavour to make it indistinguishable from a manually written document.

Teams should also create some methodology on how the data is collected and stored. You should think about how to ensure the data is accurate, how to allow changes and how to ensure that the right people provide the right information at the right time. In addition, you should include tailored reporting for different contributors.

Teams should also explore the next steps of research and progress. What would need to be done to completely automate the generation of a PEP? What needs to be put in place? How do we ensure perfect accuracy every time?

**Benefit**

This challenge has the opportunity to increase efficiency and tailor PEP to the specific recipients, while releasing capacity from the project managers. It can be applied to a wide variety of different applications based on the results and also helps improve understanding into the progress of creating a Project Execution Plan. It will provide a more efficient process and tailor report to specific recipients.

If teams are able to explore the creation of accurate natural language so that anybody can understand what the project is about in a controlled manner with minimal variation, it could potentially lead to applications in almost all technical documentation. Teams should try and address the possibilities of a future that uses systems like this for all technical documentation.
