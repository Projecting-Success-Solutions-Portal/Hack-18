# Team 5C - Knowledge Brings Results
**Solution**

"Knowledge Brings Results" have created a self contained tool that allows project managers to fill in a simple form and generate a Project Execution Plan automatically. PMs can fill in only the technical specifics of their project and get a natural language document generated for review, they can then change details or update the plan at their leisure being able to generate another full PEP at any time.
